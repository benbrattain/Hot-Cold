# Hot-or-Cold

## Description

What's the temperature like outside and what does it actually feel like? Do you need sunscreen (well, you always benefit from sunscreen) and can you get away with wearing a T-shirt? Do you need your umbrella? 

Most importantly, what will it really feel like outside in the next 36 hours? Handy for planning your day and outdoors exercise.

We tell you using our scientifically calculated heat index and wind chill factors, depending on the season.
